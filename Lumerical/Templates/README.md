# Objectives
Provide simulation templates of usual devices of SiP for use in Lumerical. Save your time in simulations of various common SiP devices or performing common simulation tasks.

1. The current folder  contains some scripted parameterized devices (such as integrated Bragg gratings, grating-assisted contra-directional couplers, straight-bent-straight (SBS) waveguide, etc). So it you want to use them in your simulations,  you may simply copy them into your simulation files and them modify them according to your requirements. 

3. Also, the current folder contains Lumerical templates providing extremely convenient ways for accomplishing some very common simulation tasks, such as calculating $\kappa$ and $\tau$ of ring resonators, simulating various directional couplers, ploting neff versus waveguide width for various modes, etc.

Note that in most files of this folder, the "model" has been coded such that it can make **automatic** configurations of the simulation range, mesh area, etc. If you don't like this, you may just copy individual structure groups into your simulation files and make setup, to save your time.
