# Objectives
Provide simulation templates of usual devices of SiP for use in Lumerical

# How to use it
These Lumerical files contains some scripted and parameterized devices (such as integrated Bragg gratings, grating-assisted contra-directional couplers, etc). So it you want to use them,  just copy the  Structure Group in your simulation files and them modify them according to your requirements. 

Note that the "model" has been coded such that it can make some automatic configurations of the simulation range, mesh area, etc.
