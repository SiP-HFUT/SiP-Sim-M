# Objectives
Provide simulation templates of usual devices of SiP for use in Lumerical

# How to use it
These Lumerical files contains some scripted and parameterized devices (such as integrated Bragg gratings, grating-assisted contra-directional couplers, etc). So it you want to use them, you can just copy the Structure Group in your simulation files. Note that in"model", I have make some cofiguration of the simulation range, mesh area, etc.
