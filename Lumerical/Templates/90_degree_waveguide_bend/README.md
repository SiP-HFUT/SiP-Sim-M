### Objective
Provide a simple template for characterizing transmission performence of  **90-degree silicon waveguide bend**. 

*model* has been scripted such that the simulation environment can be automatically configured to fit the simulated device, 

###  Manual checks are still needed before running the simulation
Note that although  the simulation environment is set to automatically fit the device,  basic manual checks are still needed before running the simulation, includingï¼›
- the wavelength range and the number of the wavelength points 
- selected modes of the ports
- directions of the ports
- source mode
- simulation time (if it is enough)
- index monitor, to check if the layout is meshed correctly, and  if the mesh resolution is enough to recover the original geometry of the layout
- etc.
