## Objectives
Provide simulation templates of various kinds of directional couplers.  

## EME and FDTD
Here, templates based on simulation methods of EME and FDTD are provided. 
- EME provides a rapid tool for characterizing the device performence as a function of the coupling length. Thus this method is faster and thus can be used for initially evaluating the required length of the coupler.
- FDTD is slower but  more accurate, and thus can be used to finalize the coupler parameters 

# How to use it
First set the basic parameters of the couplers in *model*. Then,  checking the simulation setup and make modifications if needed, such as wavelength range,  mode selections of Ports, source mode, etc.
